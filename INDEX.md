- ✅ USB cable
- ✅ 5V power supply or power bank

### Software
- ✅ Arduino IDE (1.8.x or 2.x)
- ✅ ESP32 board package
- ✅ ArduinoJson library (v6.x)

### Firebase Setup
- ✅ Firebase project: `smart-roll-call-76a46`

## 🎯 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Automatic Detection** | Detects students when they connect to hotspot |
| **Schedule-Based** | Only marks attendance during scheduled class time |
| **Time-Aware** | Syncs with NTP server for accurate time |
| **MAC Authentication** | Identifies students by device MAC address |
| **Duplicate Prevention** | Prevents marking attendance multiple times |
| **Real-time Sync** | Updates Firestore immediately |
| **Power Optimized** | Runs 24/7 on low power |
| **Multi-Class Support** | Handles multiple classes per day |
| **No Manual Check-in** | Fully automatic - no user interaction needed |

---

## 📊 How It Integrates with Your Flutter App

### Flutter App Side:
1. Teacher creates batches and adds schedules
2. Teacher registers students with their MAC addresses
3. Flutter app stores everything in Firestore

### ESP32 Side:
1. Reads schedules from Firestore
2. Detects student devices
3. Matches MAC addresses
4. Writes attendance to Firestore

### Result:
- **Seamless integration** - no code changes needed in Flutter app
- **Real-time updates** - attendance appears immediately
- **Automatic** - works in background

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### ✅ What's Secure:
- Hotspot uses WPA2 password protection
- Only writes to attendance (can't modify schedules or students)
- MAC addresses are validated against Firestore database

### ⚠️ Important Notes:
- Firebase API key is embedded (acceptable for ESP32 write-only operations)
- Ensure Firestore security rules are properly configured
- Keep your Firebase User ID confidential
- MAC addresses are considered sensitive data

### 📝 Recommended Firestore Rules:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow ESP32 to read schedules and students
    match /users/{userId}/batches/{batch=**} {
      allow read: if true;
    }
    
    // Allow ESP32 to write attendance only
    match /attendance_records/{record} {
      allow write: if request.resource.data.markedBy == "ESP32";
      allow read: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

## 📈 Expected Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Device Detection Time | 5 seconds max |
| Attendance Marking Time | 1-2 seconds |
| Schedule Refresh | Every 5 minutes |
| Time Sync | Every 1 hour |
| Max Simultaneous Devices | 4 students |
| Power Consumption | 120-180mA |
| WiFi Range | 30-50 meters |
| Uptime | 24/7 (if powered) |

3. **Verify Configuration**
   - Firebase User ID correct?
   - WiFi credentials correct?
   - Current time accurate?
   - Schedules loaded?

4. **Test Components Individually**
   - WiFi connection working?
   - Internet access working?
   - Firestore accessible?
   - Student MAC address registered?
